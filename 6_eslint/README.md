This demo shows how to integrate [ESlint](http://eslint.org/) into your build process.

1.  Run `webpack`
2.  Note errors in output coming from `ESlint`
3.  Try to fix errors in `src/index.js` and run `webpack` again
4.  Also experiment by changing the rules in `.eslintrc` (full list [here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/))
