This demo shows the super-opinionated [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/) framework.

1.   Run `webpack`
2.   See the output from `standardjs` on everything it dislikes about `src/index.html`
3.   Edit `src/index.html` to quench some error messages
4.   Repeat from 1 until `standardjs` doesn't complain!
