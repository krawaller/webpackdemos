This demo shows how to handle styles and static assets in your build process

1.  Note the image and style handling inside `src/index.js`
2.  Run `webpack`
3.  Open `index.html` in the browser to note everything works
4.  Check out `out/bundle.js` and note the `style` tags in the head and the inline image at the bottom.
